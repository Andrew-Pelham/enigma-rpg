## Archetypes

In ENIGMA there are 6 different archetypes that are used to represent the different types of adventurers which can appear. An archetype defines the outline of your character, but by no means limits it. Functionally they help to guide you when choosing equipment, identifying specialties, and finding your fit in the party; your archetype is like your trusty backup tool that can always be called on.

The six archetypes are as follows: 

- The Investigator
- The Brawler
- The Researcher
- The Entertainer
- The Explorer
- The Operator

Although a balanced group of characters often helps to diversify skill sets, by no means should the archetypes limit your choices. A group of five entertainers can be just as fun as a mix of characters. 

Furthermore, your character doesn’t have to be a human, and often the best companions aren’t! Whether you are a detective robot or a snowy white dog, you have as much creative liberty to morph the sheet to your will.
