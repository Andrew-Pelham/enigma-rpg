## Introduction

### Background

ENIGMA is a roleplaying game designed for adventure. Drawing upon old adventure novels as well as French comics with big bad recurring evil villains, ENIGMA’s system allows players to go on flashy adventures and foil dastardly plots. Just like in the books, players typically trump the baddies and rarely ever die; ENIGMA follows suit, focusing on how the players interact in scenarios and the results that linger with them for the rest of their careers.

The rules provided are intended to be light, so as not to overcomplicate the gameplay (stick to complicated villain ploys instead). The system is virtually classless, with simple archetype outlines to fill out the classic adventuring party. With ENIGMA, the narrative is reversed: action-packed daring scenes with minimal rules replace the stereotypical bland combat with crunchy, complex number work.

### Setting

ENIGMA takes its players back to a familiar history roughly between both World Wars. Ultimately it is up to the Gamemaster (or Director) to decide what has changed. Are there new continents or countries? Perhaps different weapons or technology have been produced, leading to new types of war. The one consistency is that there are always villains acting upon some secret (or not-so-secret) agenda - it is up to the players to meddle in as many ways as possible.

## The Basics

### What you need

To play ENIGMA you will need to gather a few things. Here is your shopping list:

- Dice: Standard six-sided dice are used to resolve action in ENIGMA. You will need at least one, but it would be better if players had about three each. Six-sided dice are referred to throughout the rules as d6. If a number appears in front (such as 2d6 or 4d6) this indicates you should roll that many dice.

- Pencil and Paper: Players will need to record the details of their character, important notes about their mission, and all kinds of other things. The Director will also need paper for keeping track of different elements
of the story.

- Scrap Paper: Directors will find it useful to keep a supply of paper handy, to draw rough diagrams, or keep track of the events of a story. A small whiteboard is also handy for such purposes.

### What You Do

You and your friends are going to work together to tell a dramatic, exciting story. Each player will create an adventurer to aid whilst on their journey. An adventurer has their own strengths, weaknesses, and goals that will help you roleplay them. One player will be the Director, who helps everyone along, presents challenges for the characters to overcome, and adjudicates the rules when needed.

Play is a kind of conversation, where everyone works together to put the characters in cool and/or entertaining situations. Then you will use the dice to help work out
what happens next. Sometimes you will all be working together, throwing ideas around, suggesting things, and talking over the top of each other. It is chaos, but hopefully productive, fun chaos. At other times you are going to take turns to describe what your character is doing and see the results.

### How You Do It

To resolve any action where the outcome is not clear, roll a d6. Your objective is to ‘beat the odds’ by rolling high. When the environment, skills, [*Equipment*](#equipment), or abilities make an action easier or harder you will get to roll multiple dice and keep the best or worst result.

## Making an Adventurer

### Archetypes

In ENIGMA there are 6 different archetypes that are used to represent the different types of adventurers which can appear. An archetype defines the outline of your character, but by no means limits it. Functionally they help to guide you when choosing [*Equipment*](#equipment), identifying [*Specialties*](#specialties), and finding your fit in the party; your archetype is like your trusty backup tool that can always be called on.

The six archetypes are as follows:

- The Investigator
- The Brawler
- The Researcher
- The Entertainer
- The Explorer
- The Operator

Although a balanced group of characters often helps to diversify skill sets, by no means should the archetypes limit your choices. A group of five entertainers can be just as fun as a mix of characters.

Furthermore, your character doesn’t have to be a human, and often the best companions aren’t! Whether you are a detective robot or a snowy white dog, you have as much creative liberty to morph the sheet to your will.

### Descriptors

Once you have a general idea as to the type of character you want to create, descriptors allow you to shape them.

#### Profession

This is what you do on a day-to-day basis. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a paid job, as your profession could be “drifter” or some other self-employed role.

#### Biography

This is all the government form-type information on your character. How old are you? Where were you born? Where do you live now? What is your full-given birth name? You can either fill this section out like a government form or sum it all into an elegant sentence or two.

#### Appearance

This is where you can truly describe your character’s look. What’s your resting expression? How do you stand? Do you look disheveled? You can also use this section to add clothes and other items. You can give your character whatever makes sense for them here, it just won’t have any major effect on gameplay.

#### Relationships

Choose at least one other character that will take part in the story and write a short statement about your relationship with them. This should be clear and add some interesting depth to both characters' backgrounds. For example, you could be old drinking buddies, have dated the same woman, fought in the war together, or were trained by the same master.

### Equipment

The gear, gadgets, and weapons that a character will use on their adventures encompasses [*Equipment*](#equipment). All characters have the basic clothes or items that are appropriate to their concept. [*Equipment*](#equipment) is the important and cool stuff that a character carries. A character’s [*Equipment*](#equipment) will grant bonus dice and can be anything - guns and knives to fancy clothes, wads of cash, a horse, flares, or even a dinghy.

[*Equipment*](#equipment) is always made up of an adjective and noun; Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Fast Horse, Long-ranged Rifle, Father’s Model-T, Heavy Helmet. Your character has two pieces of [*Equipment*](#equipment). Choose two items for your character; if you get stuck, there is a sample table of [*Equipment*](#equipment) on each archetype description page. Just don’t forget to add an adjective to each item!

Items should be “iconic” to your character. Think Indiana Jones’s Well-worn Whip. Each piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment) should add something to your character’s background, personality, or goals. It should make a statement about who the character is or what they do.

Discuss your [*Equipment*](#equipment) with the table. Everyone needs to be clear on what you are describing; what the [*Equipment*](#equipment) will be useful for, and when it might be a hindrance.

### Specialties

This is your chance to say what your character is great at. Sometimes a character’s specialty might be in line with their [*Equipment*](#equipment) or profession, but it just as easily can be outside.

[*Specialties*](#specialties) take the form of “-ing something”. Your character might have a specialty in Throwing  large Nets, Climbing over Walls, or even Listening to Music. These [*Specialties*](#specialties) help to build out your character as well as give you an edge during encounters. Select three [*Specialties*](#specialties) for your character, discussing with the table as you did with [*Equipment*](#equipment).

### Next Steps

Once you’ve built out your character, generate  your Lucky Saves by rolling 1d6. Then, you’re done! [*Stress*](#stress), [*Curiosities*](#curiosities), and [*Insight*](#insights) will grow and change as you progress on your adventure!

## The Archetypes

### The Investigator

With a need to uncover the hidden, characters who choose the Investigator archetype are typically the driving force when busting open hidden plots.

Investigators often have occupations like detectives, reporters, or even agents. They are keen-eyed, with a knack for puzzle-solving.

|  (2d6)   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

| **6** | Pocket knife | Police badge | Codebook | Disposable phone | Throwing knife | False documents |

### The Brawler

Always ready for a fight, the Brawler archetype is cruisin’ for a bruisin’. Characters who choose the Brawler archetype often are ready for action at a moment’s notice, weapon at the ready.

Brawlers can come from a wide variety of backgrounds, from soldiers to thugs. Proficient in all sorts of weaponry, Brawlers typically make up for social skills with thick skin.

|  (2d6)   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

| **5** | Brass knuckles | Trench knife | Arm guards | Lead pipe | Taxi cab | Rope |
| **6** | Cigar case | Shotgun | Knee pads | Fire extinguisher | Skateboard | Set of keys |

### The Researcher

This archetype would much rather have their head in a good book as opposed to a high-octane adventure. Sometimes ignorant of their surroundings, Researcher characters have a hunger for knowledge and can provide critical for coming to an answer.

As the name implies, Researchers typically come from a STEM background. Scientists, teachers, historians, and even musicians can classify as Researchers, given a certain devotion to their work.

|  (2d6)   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |

| **5** | Sample jars | Dictionary | Tool kit | Semaphore kit | Clipboard | Magnifying glass |
| **6** | Portable scale | Map collection | Geiger counter | Morse code book | Specimen jars | Weather balloon |

### The Entertainer

Not to be confused with the Scott Joplin classic, Entertainers are charismatic assets to any group. They convey many layers of thought in their speech, motion, and even stance.

Entertainer characters might be singers, dancers, or other performers, but they may also come from backgrounds like salesmen.

|  (2d6)   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **1** | Violin | Stage makeup kit | Autograph book | Portable megaphone | Tonic Water | Set of juggling balls |

| **5** | Accordion | Clown outfit | Perfume bottle | Telegrapher’s key | Roll of tickets | Stilt set |
| **6** | Ukulele | Magic wand | Cigarette holder | Public announcement flyers | Set of playing dice | Set of juggling pins |

### The Explorer

With wanderlust at their core, the Explorer archetype is not designed to stay in one place. Burdened with adventuring gear, they are used to traveling with various modes of transportation. Moreover, they have a keen sense of direction and usually have no difficulty with a map and compass.

Explorer archetype characters are often the easiest to dream up. Dilettantes, nomads, and even industrialists can act as Explorer characters.

|  (2d6)   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **1** | Compass | Flint and steel | Pith helmet | Machete | Revolver | Bug repellent |
| **2** | Map and map case | Canteen | Hiking boots | Climbing gear | Lever Action Rifle | Specimen jars |
| **3** | Sextant | First aid kit | Utility belt | Lantern | Bow and arrows | Local currency |
| **4** | Altimeter | Hunting knife | Leather backpack | Portable stove | Throwing knives | Tribal mask |
| **5** | Chronometer | Rope | Water purification tablets | Field journal | Whip | Pocketwatch |
| **6** | Signal mirror | Binoculars | Sunblock | Shovel | Spear | Compass |

### The Operator

Filling the gaps left by the previous five archetypes, the Operator specializes in something significant. Despite being an expert in what they do, Operator characters bring more than just expertise to the table.

Characters with the Operator archetype could be pilots, sea captains, authors, stock brokers, or even gurus. The one thing uniting them is that they know their craft better than anyone else.

|  (2d6)   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **1** | Wrench set | Shortwave radio | Aviator goggles | Compass | Trench gun | Thermos |

| **4** | Spare parts kit | Flashlight | Sturdy boots | Altimeter | Flare gun | Flight manual |
| **5** | Tool belt | Notebook and pen | Bandana | Chronometer | Crowbar | Aviator sunglasses |
| **6** | Socket set | Signal flags | Wristwatch | Signal mirror | Throwing knife | Box of rations |

## Gameplay

### Legs

A leg is a portion of a larger adventure. Typically every adventure has 3-5 legs, but there can be more or less depending on the type of adventure your Director creates. Legs are often enclosed and have their own arc, but relate to a bigger idea or plot.

Each leg essentially works as a oneshot that can be strung together into the larger story. Here's an example:

- Leg 1 - The Strange Auction: A mysterious idol goes missing at a high class auction and the adventurers need to hunt down it's whereabouts.  There are a few different story beats that occur like a chase and a puzzle, which result in the thief being captured. Clearly he is not the mastermind, and fenced off the idol to his boss, leading into leg 2

- Leg 2 - The Journey to Cairo: After discovering that the idol was sent to a rich philanthropist named Baron Chomsky, the adventurers catch a direct flight to Cairo. There is trouble on the plane, and shortly it is hijacked by members of a strange cult. The plane goes down, and the adventurers find themselves struggling to survive in the desert. They find an outpost and resupply after clearing it of the cultists.

- Leg 3 - An Unholy Weapon: The adventurers head into the city and find a tense struggle between the Baron and the Cultists. Both are vying for the idol and the Baron brought it one step closer to the city. The characters take a few leads from locals and head towards an abandoned temple. The Baron is attempting to use the idol to activate a powerful weapon, but the Baron and the adventurers are both ambushed by the cult!

As you can see, each leg is a contained segment of the story, like an episode of a TV show. There is a central antagonist to each, but they slowly build up from a cat burglar to the Baron.

### Scenes

A scene is a period of the story involving a specific situation, location, or group of characters. Scenes are the primary building blocks of the story and can represent anything from a few seconds to many hours of time. Each scene should have a specific objective and the scene ends when that objective has been addressed. A scene should advance the plot of the story, reveal information about a character, or add background color to the events being described. Often a scene will do all of these things at the same time.

One example would be the chase after the cat burglar in Leg 1 of our example adventure. This is an enclosed scene that might involve multiple beat the odds rolls to test the characters throughout. We can think of scenes like story beats - if someone had 30 seconds to recount the adventure, the scenes are what get recounted first.

### Turns

When it is important to know the specific actions of each character and the order in which they occur, a scene is broken into turns. A turn is a period long enough for each character to take a single action, whether that be to make an attack, deliver a rousing speech, throw an object to a companion, look up some information in their books, or perform some other task. The order within a turn is often dictated by the Director, but they may also allow the players to select an order depending on the situation.

On a turn, players declare what action their characters are taking, while the Director decides what the other characters and enemies are going to do. When all the characters involved have had a chance to act the turn ends. A new turn will begin, if necessary.

Turns are essentially like slowing down time so we can get a better picture of what is going on. This is the action packed scene in an adventure film, so we wanna get it right! Turns are often utilized in combat scenarios, or a Tumult

### Tumults

Sometimes all hell breaks loose and the characters find themselves in a combat scenario. This is known as a Tumult.

A Tumult acts like a standard scene, and players act on a turn so as to establish some sense of order. However, depending on the scenario, the players may not always act first. One example would be if the characters were ambushed while walking lazily through a bazaar.

At the beginning of a Tumult, each player rolls to see how many [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice) are available to them during the Tumult. [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice) are detailed later, but in essence, they define how many things a player can do during the Tumult.

In a Tumult, failed rolls on the players’ end as well as successful rolls on the opponents’ end can translate to an increase of [*Stress*](#stress). No actual damage is tracked or taken, but it is assumed that the character deals with a wound through an increase in [*Stress*](#stress).

### Beat The Odds

When a character attempts an action where the outcome is not immediately and/or completely obvious, you make a [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) roll. To resolve an action roll a d6. Your objective is to ‘beat the odds’ by rolling as high as possible. If you roll low, the action either failed or wasn’t quite as good as needed or expected. The lower the number, the worse the result.

| Roll | Result |
| ---- | ---- |
| **6** | Yes, and… |
| **5** | Yes… |
| **4** | Yes, but… |
| **3** | No, but… |
| **2** | No… |
| **1** | No, and… |

When you make a [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) roll your character will either succeed at what they were attempting, or they won't. This is usually enough to push your story further along, but other things can happen too.

When you attempt an action, you are asking “Does my character get what they want?” There are six possible answers to this question.

Yes and No are pretty straightforward - they tell you whether the action succeeded or not. The and and but are qualifiers that modify how good the success or how bad the failure was. When you get a qualifier the Director makes an extra statement about how the action succeeded or failed.

### Modifiers

Sometimes circumstances, [*Equipment*](#equipment), and skill will make [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) rolls easier or harder. Modifiers change the number of dice you get to roll when taking action. When rolling multiple dice, the grouping is called your dice pool.

#### Bonus Dice

Roll an additional die for each Specialty, piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment), or external factor that provides some advantage to the action being taken. The result is the single best die roll, as the player chooses.

#### Penalties

Sometimes a player might have a penalty applied from [*Equipment*](#equipment) or other external factors. For each penalty applied, the player rolls one less dice. Penalties can only ever reduce your dice pool to 1.

### Lucky Saves

During character creation, as well as the start of each new lrg of an adventure, your character generates 1d6 Lucky Saves. These represent the sheer dumb luck pulp adventure characters have, which can get them out of a bind. Although they are considered modifiers Lucky Saves are spent in two ways:

#### Before Rolling

For each Lucky Save you spend before making a [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) roll, you may add one bonus die to the roll.

#### After Rolling

For each Lucky Save you spend after making a [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) roll, you may increase the value on a die by one. Note that if rolling with penalty dice, you still take the lowest result. For example, if you roll two 3’s, and spend a Lucky Save to increase one to a 4, you still take the 3.

Both modes of Lucky Saves can be used on the same roll as well, so you can add bonus dice and increase the values if you really need a good result. Keep in mind that you won’t get more points until the next Leg.

### Curiosities

As adventurers encounter the weird, strange, and sinister, they can add to their [*Curiosities*](#curiosities). At the Director’s discretion, the players can add an idea, group, or person to their sheet after learning more about it.  

Often this occurs at the end of a Leg. The characters bust the secret hideout of a dastardly cult and thus earn a [*Curiosity*](#curiosities) about the cult at large. Another example could be unearthing an idol of a lost civilization and thereby gaining a [*Curiosity*](#curiosities) for said civilization.

[*Curiosities*](#curiosities) can then be leveraged as Modifiers when making [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) rolls. If a roll involves something a player has a [*Curiosity*](#curiosities) about, it grants them a bonus die. If a player has a [*Curiosity*](#curiosities) about a cult, they could apply a bonus die to breaking into the cult’s secret door, escaping a monster the cult has summoned, or even punching a member of the cult in the face.

Each character can have a maximum of two [*Curiosities*](#curiosities). If you have two and the Director offers another, you can choose to discard one and add the new one to your sheet.

### Stress

No adventurer is invincible, as slowly the strain of boldly going into the unknown will catch up to them. This is represented as [*Stress*](#stress) and the resulting [*Knockouts*](#knockouts).

Whenever a character has something negative happen to them, the Director can give that character [*Stress*](#stress). Their [*Stress*](#stress) ranges from 0-6 at any given time and is often accumulated from negative [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) dice rolls. A character might gain a point of [*Stress*](#stress) by rolling a 1 when attempting to climb a cliffside and subsequently falling to their doom. Alternatively, a character might gain a point of [*Stress*](#stress) when a thug scores a successful hit on them with his club.

[*Stress*](#stress) can be managed anytime the characters are taking a substantial rest. This may mean a full eight hours of sleep, or just a well-deserved stop for tea in a calming location. When this happens, all characters are allowed to make a [*Stress Test*](#stress).

### Stress Test

During a [*Stress Test*](#stress), each player rolls 1d6. If the result is higher than their current [*Stress*](#stress), it decreases by one. For example, if a player has 3 [*Stress*](#stress), and they roll a 5 on their [*Stress Test*](#stress), their [*Stress*](#stress) decreases to 2.

The players should narrate how their character recovers (or doesn’t) during this [*Stress Test*](#stress). Do they meditate? Maybe they shoot cans with their revolver? Perhaps they give a rousing rant about how dire their situation is!

### Knockouts

When a character reaches 6 [*Stress*](#stress), they gain a [*Knockout*](#knockouts). This represents a character finally buckling under the tension and going under. This doesn’t always narratively equate to being knocked out – it may be in a brawl, but it can also just symbolize a character becoming too tired to go on.

Once a character gains a [*Knockout*](#knockouts), their [*Stress*](#stress) reset to 0 and they are incapacitated for the rest of the Scene or Tumult. The remaining players will have to figure out what to do with them until they wake up during the next scene. [*Knockouts*](#knockouts) are permanent, and once you accrue them you can never get rid of them. Should your character obtain four [*Knockouts*](#knockouts), they become too weary to go on and must cease adventuring and enter Retirement.

### Retirement

Not even pulp characters are invincible, and eventually they must meet their end. If your character reaches 4 [*Knockouts*](#knockouts), fear not, because they are not out of the game immediately.

Retired characters continue play until the end of the adventure’s Leg. Until then, their [*Stress*](#stress) will not increase, but they cannot receive bonus dice Modifiers to any roll.

### Insights

The silver lining to gaining [*Knockouts*](#knockouts) is that you also simultaneously gain an [*Insight*](#insights).

An [*Insight*](#insights) is another experiential bonus you can obtain only by screwing up. [*Insight*](#insights) reflect the nature of [*Knockouts*](#knockouts); if you gain that 6th point of [*Stress*](#stress) by nearly drowning in a rushing river, you gain an [*Insight*](#insights) into staying afloat and buoyancy.

[*Insight*](#insights) can be used whenever you have another player in your situation, granting them a bonus die. You learned your lesson about drowning, and will happily pass some words of encouragement to your party members.

Your own rolls can’t be modified by your own [*Insight*](#insights). In good pulp adventure fashion, it is a comedy to have the same character suffer from recurring pain, even if their friends learn from their mistakes

### Blammo! Dice

As detailed in the Tumult section, [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice) create the action economy for a combat scenario. To generate them, each player gets 1d6 to roll but can add more bonus dice for [*Equipment*](#equipment) and [*Curiosities*](#curiosities) like any other roll.

To do anything in the Tumult that would require daring wits or skill, you must spend a [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice). When you want to narrate your character’s action, you can ask the Director if said action would cost any [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice).

Some examples of times when you would have to spend a [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice) include:

- Running past a group of guards to snatch a precious idol
- Firing a volley of bullets into a crowd of thugs
- Cracking a safe whilst being pursued by the police

Examples of non [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice) actions include:

- Putting distance between you and a growling hound
- Pulling a lever to open a portcullis
- Firing warning shots into the air

Spending a [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice) allow you to make a [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) roll with one dice. The only way to add bonus dice to this roll is by spending more [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice). For example, if you spend 5 [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice), you get to make your [*Beat The Odds*](#beat-the-odds) roll with 4 bonus dice.

Moreover, at the end of a Tumult, you enter the recovery phase. For each [*Blammo! Dice*](#Blammo! Dice) you have remaining, you can roll 1d6. For every 6 you roll, you can redirect your bravery and reduce your [*Stress*](#stress) by 1 point.

## Running The Show

### The Director

In order to facilitate the massive adventures the players will take on, someone must take on the role of the Director. They help to weave the players’ story together, creating a good time for all.

#### Talking is Good

Start your game with a conversation. Talk about what players want out of the game, what you want, and where those ideas overlap. Those overlaps are likely where everyone is going to have the most fun. At the very least you should work together to establish the tone of your shared story. Talk about this stuff too, so that everyone is clear of the specifics.

Talk during the game too. Encourage players to share ideas and give input into scenes, objectives, and the challenges characters face. If you need to clarify ideas, themes or issues then do that.

#### Listening is Good

If there is going to be talk there needs to be listening. Listen to your players and the things they tell you, either in conversation or when they do things with their character. Do stuff that relates to the things written on the player’s character sheets, because that is what they think is cool

#### When Playing

When running games don’t plan too much ahead of time. The dice rolls are going to direct a lot of the action, and you and the players will fill in the gaps by applying Conditions and Details. Here are some tips to keep things moving and help you enjoy the game as much as the players do.

- Keep things simple: Do not complicate your job by introducing lots of sub-plots or convoluted twists. Things will get all messed about by themselves and the story will run off on tangents that you never dreamed of. That being said, should there be too many threads, they can all lead back to the evil overlord.

- You are not the enemy: this may seem obvious, but is worth stating. Your role is to help guide the story in interesting directions, not to exhaust everyone. You can give players hints and ideas if you think this will lead to a better story. Sometimes you will portray the adversaries and are expected to do so vigorously but fairly. Other times you will get to be an ally, companion, or peer, and once again you should be true to the spirit of the game.

- Say “Yes”: if players make suggestions or ask questions it is probably because they are interested in what is going on. They probably have a cool idea to introduce to the story. Encourage this and confidently say “yes” to requests. This doesn’t mean you should let players get anything they want – but you should let players introduce elements into the story when the time is right.

- Make rolls meaningful: Every time you call for a die roll it should mean something interesting is going to happen, NO MATTER THE RESULT. Don’t have players make rolls if the result is not important to the story, or if failure will stop the momentum of the story

### Rest and Recuperation

During games characters will accumulate lots of [*Stress*](#stress). [*Stress*](#stress) is always recovered at a time and rate appropriate to the story. If the players want to keep forging ahead through the night, don’t let them make a [*Stress*](#stress) Test.

That being said, if every character gets knocked out because of mismanaged [*Stress*](#stress), don’t let that halt the story progression. One simple solution is to have all the players awake, just to find themselves captured by the enemy!

### Rewards and Treasure

As the party moves along with their journey, they should earn rewards in a variety of ways. While not always Holy Grails, the rewards should equal the risk involved.

- Physical Treasure: It never hurts to have a box of jewels or an expensive painting inside of a secret lair, but as a Director you will need to be careful; often treasure can be used as a MacGuffin to the plot, so an overabundance of it can confuse or dilute the main objective.

- Allies and Connections: Having a pal in this line of business is always useful. Once the party can sufficiently help out an NPC, you can have them return in countless scenarios. These connections can also unlock new modes of travel, money-making schemes, or even inside information

- Insights: As noted in the Gameplay section, Insights are a natural reward for screwing up. When a player earns one, work with them to develop a succinct description of the insight. For example, if the knockout was from fleeing a large lizard, the Insight should be specific to capture the fear of a creature but generic enough to apply to more than just lizards.

- Shortcuts: All of the above rewards can be boiled down into shortcuts. If the players think critically and roleplay well, they should be rewarded with skipping over obstacles and getting themselves into a better position than before.

### Damage and Stress

In ENIGMA, there is no physical damage or wounds for the players to worry about; in nearly any pulp adventure, pain isn’t what stops the plot from moving forward.

This doesn’t mean that characters don’t get injured, but rather, any injuries manifest as an increase of overall Stress. If a character twists their ankle, their Stress should increase yes, but they still narratively stop and bandage the wound or find a stick to walk with.

When thinking of how much Stress to increase given a situation, you can follow the table below for sample Stress increases. Self increases correspond with players rolling poorly in dire situations, and opponent increases apply to a foe when either a player or enemy attacks

| Self | Opponent | Stress |
| 1 | 6 | 1-2 |
| 2,3 | 4,5 | 1 |
| 4,5,6 | 1,2,3| 0 |

Enemies and Obstacles
All the characters, monsters, traps, villains, terrain features, creatures, and obstacles that are encountered during a story are defined in much the same way as characters. You are not confined by any rules or restrictions when creating characters or obstacles, the only thing you must do is make them entertaining and interesting.
NPC’s and other figures you control typically don’t manage Stress in the exact same way as players; that would simply put too much strain on the Director.

To gauge when an opponent may be out for the count (or ready to run), you can tally the Stress they rack up during a Tumult. Follow the table below for sample thresholds.

| Enemy Type | Stress Maximum |
| Minion | 1 |
| Lieutenant | 2-3 |
| Villain | 4-5 |

### Interpreting Dice Rolls

As a Director, it is up to you to manage what the pips on the cubes really mean.

When a player rolls well, feel free to ask them how they envision the result; it’s totally fine to give them more agency as a reward! If a player rolls poorly, or has a setback as part of their roll (4,2,1), you have to inject some sort of modifier to the desired outcome. This begs the question: How do I fairly detract from the original idea?

One option is to consider the severity of the roll. For something trivial, like looking for a figure in a crowd, a bad roll shouldn’t result in a cataclysmic result - they might just lose sight of the desired target.

As a Director, you also have complete control over the characters’ Stress. You can always rely on this stat when interpreting dice rolls. Unsure on how to narratively explain a failure? Increase their stress. This also applies to positive rolls; players escape with the perfect plan? Feel free to take a point off.

Even though you have an iron grip on the Stress stat, you shouldn’t rely on it as a penalty too much. Narrative options are usually more fun, and add complexity to the story.
