## Introduction

### Background

ENIGMA is a roleplaying game designed for adventure. Drawing upon old adventure novels as well as French comics with big bad recurring evil villains, ENIGMA’s system allows players to go on flashy adventures and foil dastardly plots. Just like in the books, players typically trump the baddies and rarely ever die; ENIGMA follows suit, focusing on how the players interact in scenarios and the results that linger with them for the rest of their careers.

The rules provided are intended to be light, so as not to overcomplicate the gameplay (stick to complicated villain ploys instead). The system is virtually classless, with simple archetype outlines to fill out the classic adventuring party. With ENIGMA, the narrative is reversed: action-packed daring scenes with minimal rules replace the stereotypical bland combat with crunchy, complex number work.

### Setting

ENIGMA takes its players back to a familiar history roughly between both World Wars. Ultimately it is up to the Gamemaster (or Director) to decide what has changed. Are there new continents or countries? Perhaps different weapons or technology have been produced, leading to new types of war. The one consistency is that there are always villains acting upon some secret (or not-so-secret) agenda - it is up to the players to meddle in as many ways as possible.

## The Basics

### What you need

To play ENIGMA you will need to gather a few things. Here is your shopping list:

#### Dice

Standard six-sided dice are used to resolve action in ENIGMA. You will need at least one, but it would be better if players had about three each. Six-sided dice are referred to throughout the rules as d6. If a number appears in front (such as 2d6 or 4d6) this indicates you should roll that many dice.

#### Pencil and Paper

Players will need to record the details of their character, important notes about their mission, and all kinds of other things. The Director will also need paper for keeping track of different elements
of the story.

#### Scrap Paper

Directors will find it useful to keep a supply of paper handy, to draw rough diagrams, or keep track of the events of a story. A small whiteboard is also handy for such purposes.

### What You Do

You and your friends are going to work together to tell a dramatic, exciting story. Each player will create an adventurer to aid whilst on their journey. An adventurer has their own strengths, weaknesses, and goals that will help you roleplay them. One player will be the Director, who helps everyone along, presents challenges for the characters to overcome, and adjudicates the rules when needed.

Play is a kind of conversation, where everyone works together to put the characters in cool and/or entertaining situations. Then you will use the dice to help work out
what happens next. Sometimes you will all be working together, throwing ideas around, suggesting things, and talking over the top of each other. It is chaos, but hopefully productive, fun chaos. At other times you are going to take turns to describe what your character is doing and see the results.

### How You Do It

To resolve any action where the outcome is not clear, roll a d6. Your objective is to ‘beat the odds’ by rolling high. When the environment, skills, equipment, or abilities make an action easier or harder you will get to roll multiple dice and keep the best or worst result.


## Making an Adventurer

### Archetypes

In ENIGMA there are 6 different archetypes that are used to represent the different types of adventurers which can appear. An archetype defines the outline of your character, but by no means limits it. Functionally they help to guide you when choosing equipment, identifying specialties, and finding your fit in the party; your archetype is like your trusty backup tool that can always be called on.

The six archetypes are as follows:

- The Investigator
- The Brawler
- The Researcher
- The Entertainer
- The Explorer
- The Operator

Although a balanced group of characters often helps to diversify skill sets, by no means should the archetypes limit your choices. A group of five entertainers can be just as fun as a mix of characters.

Furthermore, your character doesn’t have to be a human, and often the best companions aren’t! Whether you are a detective robot or a snowy white dog, you have as much creative liberty to morph the sheet to your will.

### Descriptors

Once you have a general idea as to the type of character you want to create, descriptors allow you to shape them.

#### Profession

This is what you do on a day-to-day basis. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a paid job, as your profession could be “drifter” or some other self-employed role.

#### Biography

This is all the government form-type information on your character. How old are you? Where were you born? Where do you live now? What is your full-given birth name? You can either fill this section out like a government form or sum it all into an elegant sentence or two.

#### Appearance

This is where you can truly describe your character’s look. What’s your resting expression? How do you stand? Do you look disheveled? You can also use this section to add clothes and other items. You can give your character whatever makes sense for them here, it just won’t have any major effect on gameplay.

#### Relationships

Choose at least one other character that will take part in the story and write a short statement about your relationship with them. This should be clear and add some interesting depth to both characters' backgrounds. For example, you could be old drinking buddies, have dated the same woman, fought in the war together, or were trained by the same master.

### Equipment

The gear, gadgets, and weapons that a character will use on their adventures encompasses equipment. All characters have the basic clothes or items that are appropriate to their concept. Equipment is the important and cool stuff that a character carries. A character’s equipment will grant bonus dice and can be anything - guns and knives to fancy clothes, wads of cash, a horse, flares, or even a dinghy. 

Equipment is always made up of an adjective and noun; Rusting Sword, Long Rope, Fast Horse, Long-ranged Rifle, Father’s Model-T, Heavy Helmet. Your character has two pieces of Equipment. Choose two items for your character; if you get stuck, there is a sample table of equipment on each archetype description page. Just don’t forget to add an adjective to each item!

Items should be “iconic” to your character. Think Indiana Jones’s Well-worn Whip. Each piece of equipment should add something to your character’s background, personality, or goals. It should make a statement about who the character is or what they do.

Discuss your equipment with the table. Everyone needs to be clear on what you are describing; what the equipment will be useful for, and when it might be a hindrance.

### Specialties

This is your chance to say what your character is great at. Sometimes a character’s specialty might be in line with their equipment or profession, but it just as easily can be outside.

Specialties take the form of “-ing something”. Your character might have a specialty in Throwing  large Nets, Climbing over Walls, or even Listening to Music. These specialties help to build out your character as well as give you an edge during encounters. Select three specialties for your character, discussing with the table as you did with equipment.

### Next Steps

Once you’ve built out your character, generate  your Lucky Saves by rolling 1d6. Then, you’re done! Stress, Curiosities, and Insights will grow and change as you progress on your adventure!
