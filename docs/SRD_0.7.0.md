## Introduction

### Background

Enigma is a roleplaying game designed for high octane adventures. Inspired by old pulp adventure novels and Franco-Belgian comics, players lead their characters into the unknown to foil cliche villains and their dastardly plots.

## The Basics

In order to play Enigma, you need these rules, some 6 sided dice, pencils, and paper. Designate one person as the Director, and have them read the rules on running the game. You will be telling a story as a group, facilitated by the Director. During a session, the characters embark on an adventure Leg, often a component of a larger story. Players will roll the dice, in what's called a Gamble, in order to resolve risky actions. 

## Notation

Throughout these rules, six sided dice are refered to as a "d6". A number preceding this convention indicates how many, so five dice would be "5d6".

## The Cast

The Cast is the team of player characters acting together. It is the unit that explores, fights, schemes, and suffers consequences as one. In the fiction, they are a band of professionals bound by shared aims and novel circumstances.

## Making a Character

### The Adventuring Spirit

In Enigma, your character isn't a villain or ruthless killer; they are a hero. They might throw a punch in a bar brawl but they wouldn't murder somebody in cold blood. When you create your character ask yourself: do I feel like my character is a "good guy"?

### Archetypes

In Enigma there are 6 different archetypes that represent the typical characters in pulp adventure. An archetype defines the outline of your character and can guide you when choosing Equipment, identifying Knacks, and finding your fit in The Cast.

The six archetypes are as follows:

- The Investigator
- The Brawler
- The Researcher
- The Entertainer
- The Explorer
- The Operator

### Description

Once you have a general character idea, you can describe them with the following fields.

#### Profession

This is what your character does on a day-to-day basis. It could be a paid job like "Accountant" or a descriptor like "Drifter"

#### Biography

This is all the statistical information on your character. How old are you? Where were you born? Where do you live now? What is your full-given birth name?

#### Appearance

This is where you can truly describe your character's look. What’s their resting expression? How do they stand? Do they look disheveled or refined? What stands out as unique? You can also use this section to add clothes and other non-trivial items, whatever makes sense for your character.

#### Drive

This is what keeps your character going. They may have an estate back home to take care of, a yearn for another breaking news story, or even just untreated wanderlust.

#### Relationships

Select at least one other player at the table, and form a connection between your character and theirs.

### Equipment

Every character can carry the necessary items they need for survival on their person but Equipment describes the items that are iconic for them. These are the things that your character is never seen without: a trusty whip, your grandfather's revolver, a professor's folding trowel.

Each piece of Equipment your character has should help tell their story. It can be anything, not just a tool: a moldy sandwich, a dirty washrag, and an ancient stick, etc. Select up to two pieces of Equipment that help shape your character.

### Knacks

This is your chance to say what your character is great at. Sometimes a character's Knack might be in line with their Equipment or profession, but it just as easily can be outside.

Knacks are meant to be specific. Avoid generics like "Listening" or "Shooting". Instead, your character might have a Knack in "Throwing large nets", "Climbing over walls", or even "Listening to organ music". Select up to three Knacks for your character.

### Catchphrase

Every hero also has a recognizable way of speaking, which culminates in a catchphrase. Come up with a phrase or term your character might use; 

### Next Steps

Once you’ve built out your character, generate your character's Lucky Saves by rolling 1d6. Peril and Blammo! Dice both start at zero.

## Gameplay

### Gambles

Whenever an character wants to do something that might fail, they make a Gamble. To do this, the player rolls 1d6, adding any relevant Bonus Dice.

#### Success

If any die results in a 5 or 6, the action succeeds, and the player narrates what happens.

#### Blunder

If the result is a 1–4, the action fails, and the Director describes what happens. Whenever a Gamble results in a blunder, the player adds 1 Blammo! Die to their sheet.

#### Peril Increases

Regardless of the outcome, a character's Peril increases by 1 for every 1 rolled. This increase is incorporated narratively into the result.

### Modifiers

Depending on your circumstances, you may add or remove dice from the pool.

#### Bonus Dice

Add 1d6 for each relevant Knack, piece of Equipment, Blammo! Die, or external advantage that applies to the action.

#### Penalties

Some Equipment or external factors may impose penalties. For each penalty, remove 1d6. A Gamble can never be reduced below 1d6, no matter how many penalties apply.

### Helping Out

Sometimes a character might ask their friends for help. For each character that can realistically assist in the gamble, add 1d6.

### Group Gambles

If all of the characters are working to accomplish or survive something, they make a Group Gamble. The players each make a Gamble as they normally would, applying any relevant Bonus Dice. If the majority of the Gambles result in a success, the characters succeed as a whole. Otherwise, the Group Gamble results in a blunder. Players increase their own peril when rolling 1's, as normal.

### Blammo! Dice

Whenever a character fails a Gamble, their player gains a Blammo! Die. There is no limit to how many Blammo! Dice a character may accrue, and they can be spent on any Gamble.

To spend a Blammo! Die, the player must declare a unique sound effect, one that hasn't been used yet by any other player. They then describe where that sound effect appears if the Gamble succeeds and add 1d6 to their roll. For example, a player throwing a vase at a goon might say, “PLUNK!” and narrate the moment the vase crashes into the goon's head.

Unlike Lucky Saves, Blammo! Dice must be spent before the roll. If a Gamble is already resolved, it's too late to use them.

### Lucky Saves

At the start of a Leg, each character adds 1d6 Lucky Saves, with a max of 6.These represent the sheer dumb luck pulp adventure characters have, which can get them out of a bind. For each Lucky Save a player spends after making a Gamble, they may increase the value on a die by one. This is useful to increase dice values to successes as well as increase 1's to avoid Peril increase.

### Catchphrases

Once per Leg of an adventure you a character can speak their catchphrase to re-roll a Gamble. The new result replaces the previous roll.

### Peril

A character’s Peril ranges from 0–6 at any given time, and is increased by enemies and 1's rolled on Gambles.

Peril can be managed during an adventure by taking a Rest; this must be done in a relatively safe environment.

At the end of a Leg, all Peril resets back to 0.

### Rest

When the characters take a Rest, each player rolls 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to their current Peril, it decreases by 1.

### Knockouts

When a character reaches 6 Peril, they gain a Knockout. It doesn’t always mean being literally knocked out. It might happen during a brawl, but it could also symbolize a character becoming too fatigued or overwhelmed to continue.

Once a character gains a Knockout, their Peril resets to 0, and they are incapacitated for the rest of the Scene. The Cast will need to decide what to do with them until they recover in the next Scene. 

Knockouts are permanent. If a character gains four Knockouts, they must enter Retirement.

### Retirement

Retired characters continue to play until the end of the current adventure’s Leg. Until then, their Peril no longer increases, but they cannot gain Bonus Dice from modifiers on any roll. At the end of the Leg, their adventuring career comes to an end. Narrate what happens to them, then roll up a new character.

## Running The Show

### Adventures

An adventure is the overarching story that the Director and the players craft together over a series of sessions. 

An typical Adventure focuses on a central villain, the villain's master plan, and the components of a plan that the players interface with.

### Legs

A Leg is a segment of an adventure. Most adventures have 3–5 Legs, though the number can vary depending on the type of story the Director creates. Each Leg is usually self-contained with its own arc, while still tying into the main plot. The Leg is played by traversing a series of Scenes leading up to an explosive end.

A typical Leg will contain a broad overview of the setting, a cold open to get the players into the action, locations filled with set pieces and clues, and a final showdown with the villain or his accomplices.

A Leg might also contain wildcard encounters to shake things up, vignettes to help illustrate the scenes, and failsafe plans to ensure a villain gets to make an appearance at the end of a leg.

### Scenes

Each Leg is broken into a series of Scenes; You can think of each Scene as a story beat. A Scene typically involves several Gambles to determine the outcomes of the players' actions, and is typically centered around a Key Location.

### Key Locations

Adventure Legs will contain a set of Key Locations. Each has a cast of characters, obstacles, and often clues about the villainous scheme. The Cast will traverse through various Key Locations until they ultimately reach a final climactic moment at the end of a Leg.

Every Key Location also contains a Wide Shot, which helps fill out the set pieces and allows the players to have some narrative agency in the worldbuilding.

### Tumults

Sometimes, all hell breaks loose and the characters find themselves in a high-stakes scenario. This is known as a Tumult. In a Tumult, time slows down, and players take turns.

During a Tumult, the players always act first and can choose any turn order, even changing it from round to round. On their turn, a player may do one distinct thing. If the action involves risk or skill, the Director will call for a Gamble. Once all players have acted, the Director describes what the enemies and environment do in response.

A Tumult typically ends when one side is knocked out, flees, or surrenders. It’s ultimately up to the Director to decide when a Tumult is over.

### The Director

In order to facilitate the adventures the characters will take on, someone must take on the role of the Director.

As the Director you will present the Scenes and adjudicate the Gambles made by the players. Here are some things to keep in mind while running a game:

- Don't feel the need to add lots of sub-plots and things happening in the background.

- You are not the villain. Root for the characters. Help players spot Bonus Dice they qualify for.

- When in doubt, err on the rule of cool. If you don't know whether or not the players' zany plan will actually work, let them try! 

### Wide Shot

This is a crucial tool for the Director to balance the shared narration. When The Cast first visits a Key Location, you will initially describe the space around the characters. Then, allow each player to describe something else in their field of view their character can see. Getting into a taxi? What does each character see that makes them feel uneasy?

Ask leading questions that force them to describe more than just a building or a person. It's very bright here, what might be contributing to the light? The basement is dark and smells strange, what is making the smell worse?

### Investigating

It is common for a character  to look for clues, or even more generally, get a closer look at the world around them. If the situation lends well to it or the character has sufficient skill for investigating, they automatically gain any useful information available. If the situation is more random or the outcome isn't certain, you can ask the player to roll 1d6.

No Bonus Dice, Peril, or Lucky Saves apply here; this isn't a Gamble. Closer to 1 means less information and closer to 6 means more information. Either way they gain enough information to keep the story driving forward.

### Damage and Peril

In Enigma, there are no hit points or wounds to track; injuries raise a character’s Peril. If a character twists their ankle, their Peril increases, but they still narratively stop and bandage the wound.

As the Director, it is your job to dole out Peril when necessary. Here is a list of some common places this might happen:

- Any 1's rolled on a Gamble
- When an enemy targets a character
- When the environment is particularly unforgiving, weather, etc.
- When they experience the weird, strange, odd, or eldritch
- When you feel like it

### Adventuring Strain

While adventuring, characters will accumulate lots of Peril. Peril is always recovered at a time and rate appropriate to the story. If The Cast forges ahead through the night, don’t let them reap the benefits of a Rest.

That being said, if every character gets knocked out because of mismanaged Peril, don’t let that halt the story progression. One simple solution is to have all the characters awake, just to find themselves captured by the enemy!

### Dangers

As the Director, you must present the players with the obstacles and enemies to encounter. Whether that be henchmen or a boulder rolling down the corridor, these barriers make the game exciting.

NPC’s and other figures you control don’t manage Peril or dice rolls in the same way as players. Every enemy has a Success Threshold and a Danger Rating. 

If a player's action targets an enemy, and is successful, mark one success against that enemy. When they reach the threshold, that enemy is incapacitated and out of the picture.

On the enemies' turn, each enemy can "dole out" Peril according to their Danger Rating. No rolls involved from the Director or the players. This increase can be interpreted narratively as an attack, threatening move, or general chaos.

Below are some sample templates for enemy types:

| **Enemy Type** |**Success Threshold** | **Danger Rating** |
| Minion | 1 | 1 |
| Lieutenant | 2 | 3 |
| Villain | 4 | 5 |

As the Director you also can take whatever creative liberties you see fit in any given scenario. This can mean manipulating Success Thresholds or Danger Ratings as needed or removing them entirely.
