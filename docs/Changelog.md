## Rules & Feature Changes – SRD 1.3 → 1.4

### Character Creation

- **New Feature – Catchphrase:** Once per adventure, a player can speak their character’s catchphrase to automatically succeed on a *Gamble*.

---

### Gambles

- **Peril on 1’s:** Whenever a *Gamble* is rolled, *Peril* increases by **1 for each die that shows a 1**, regardless of success or failure.
- **Helping Out:** New rule allowing another player to contribute 1 bonus die from a relevant *Knack* or *Equipment* to another player’s roll.
- **Blunders:** No longer automatically increase *Peril* for all players in a *Group Gamble*.

---

### Resting

- **Relationship-Based Resting System:**
  - Rest with an existing relationship: normal peril reduction roll (reduce by 1 on success).
  - Rest with a new partner: add the new relationship to your sheet and reduce *Peril* by **2** on success.
  - Rest alone: same as resting with an existing relationship, but cannot rest alone twice in a row.

---

### Knockouts

- **Moments System (New):** When gaining a Knockout, choose one of four effects (each usable only once per character):
  1. **Last Stand** – One final *Gamble* with +1 bonus die before going down.
  2. **Rousing Speech** – All allies reduce *Peril* by 1.
  3. **Parting Gift** – Give one ally an item for +2 bonus dice on their next *Gamble*.
  4. **Final Vision** – Notice something important; when you recover, any player may add it as a *Thread*.
- **Insights Removed:** The *Insights* mechanic has been replaced entirely by *Moments*.

---

### Dangers

- **Danger Rating System:** Replaces static dice pools for enemies.
  - Danger Rating is the amount of *Peril* an enemy can inflict on their turn, which can be split between targets or focused on one.
