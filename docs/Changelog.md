# Changelog

## 0.6.2
- **Gambles:** Removed the need to set stakes before rolling to preserve game momentum
- **Snooping:** Reworded rolling 1d6 for snooping so it seemed less like a mechanic and more like a gm tool

---

## 0.6.1
- **Terminology:** "The Crew" renamed to "The Cast" to keep in line with the genre.
- **Encounters:** Renamed to **Scenes** in order to keep parity with future Director Toolkit.
- **Snooping:** Added 1d6 dice roll when searching for clues or information. No bonuses applied; closer to 1 is less info, 6 is more info.

---

## 0.6.0
- **Catchphrases:** Now **once per Leg**; **re-roll a Gamble** and replace the old result. Replaces “auto-success once per adventure.”
- **Resting:** Simplified. Each player **rolls 1d6; on ≤ current Peril, reduce Peril by 1**. Relationship rules removed.
- **Group Gambles:** Clarified that **1s add Peril only to the roller**.
- **Knockouts:** Removed “Moments” choice on knockout. Text clarifies The Crew decides what to do with the downed character until recovery.
- **Threads:** Removed as a mechanic (and as a source of Bonus Dice).

---

## 0.5.0
- **Catchphrases:** Once per adventure, auto-succeed on a *Gamble* by speaking your catchphrase.
- **Peril on 1’s:** +1 *Peril* for every die showing a 1 on any *Gamble*.
- **Helping Out:** Other players can contribute 1 bonus die from a *Knack* or *Equipment*.
- **Group Gambles:** Blunders no longer automatically increase *Peril* for all players.
- **Resting Overhaul:** New relationship-based resting system; resting with a new partner can reduce *Peril* by 2.
- **Moments:** New knockout effects (Last Stand, Rousing Speech, Parting Gift, Final Vision) replace *Insights*.
- **Danger Rating:** Enemies now have a *Danger Rating* for how much *Peril* they can inflict per turn.
