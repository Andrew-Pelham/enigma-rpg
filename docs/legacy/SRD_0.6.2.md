## Introduction

### Background

Enigma is a roleplaying game designed for high octane adventures. Inspired by old pulp adventure novels and Franco-Belgian comics, players lead their characters into the unknown to foil cliche villains and their dastardly plots.

### Setting

Enigma rewinds time to a familiar history in the early 20th century. Ultimately it is up to the game master (or [*Director*](#the-director)) to decide what has changed. Are there new continents or countries? Perhaps advanced technologies are now common. Regardless, sinister villains run amuck, waiting for the death defying, luck toting cartoon pulp heroes to meddle in their plans.

## The Basics

In order to play Enigma, you simply need these rules, some 6 sided dice, pencils, and paper. Designate one person as the [*Director*](#the-director), and have them read the rules on running the game. You will be telling a story as a group, facilitated by the [*Director*](#the-director).

## The Cast

The Cast is the team of player characters acting together. It is the unit that explores, fights, schemes, and suffers consequences as one. When rules affect the whole group, they target The Cast. When choices must be made under pressure, The Cast decides. In the fiction, they are a band of professionals bound by shared aims and rival obligations.

## Making a Character

### The Adventuring Spirit

In Enigma, your character isn't a villain or ruthless killer; they are an adventurer. They might throw a punch in a bar brawl but they wouldn't murder somebody in cold blood. They might wallop a goon with a nearby chair but they are still good-hearted. They are imperfect, have flaws, and will stumble, but are fundamentally heroic. When you create your character ask yourself: do I feel like my character is a "good guy"?

### Archetypes

In Enigma there are 6 different archetypes that represent the typical characters in pulp adventure. An archetype defines the outline of your character, but by no means limits it. They help to guide you when choosing [*Equipment*](#equipment), identifying [*Knacks*](#knacks), and finding your fit in The Cast.

The six archetypes are as follows:

- [*The Investigator*](#the-investigator)
- [*The Brawler*](#the-brawler)
- [*The Researcher*](#the-researcher)
- [*The Entertainer*](#the-entertainer)
- [*The Explorer*](#the-explorer)
- [*The Operator*](#the-operator)

Although a balanced group of characters keeps things diverse, by no means should the archetypes limit your choices. Furthermore, your character doesn’t have to be a human, and often the best companions aren’t!

### Description

Once you have a general character idea, you can describe them with the following fields.

#### Profession

This is what your character does on a day-to-day basis. It could be a paid job like "Accountant" or a descriptor like "Drifter"

#### Biography

This is all the statistical information on your character. How old are you? Where were you born? Where do you live now? What is your full-given birth name?

#### Appearance

This is where you can truly describe your character's look. What’s their resting expression? How do they stand? Do they look disheveled or refined? What stands out as unique? You can also use this section to add clothes and other non-trivial items, whatever makes sense for your character.

#### Drive

This is what keeps your character going. They may have an estate back home to take care of, a yearn for another breaking news story, or even just untreated wanderlust. This shouldn't necessarily be a specific goal to complete, like "find my lost father" but "The hunt for my lost father" could be a drive to keep your character adventuring. Each [*Archetype*](#archetypes) has a list of sample [*Drives*](#drive) you can use if you get stuck.

#### Relationships

Select one other player at the table, and form a connection between your character and theirs. You could have been war buddies, old rivals, or even something as simple as childhood friends.

### Equipment

Every character needs tools to help them brave the unknown. This is where [*Equipment*](#equipment) comes into play. Every character can carry the necessary items they need for survival on their person but [*Equipment*](#equipment) describes the items that are iconic for them. These are the things that your character is never seen without: a trusty whip, your grandfather's revolver, a professor's folding trowel.

Each piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment) your character has should help tell their story. It can be anything, not just a tool: a moldy sandwich, a dirty washrag, and an ancient stick, etc. Select up to two pieces of [*Equipment*](#equipment) that help shape your character.

### Knacks

This is your chance to say what your character is great at. Sometimes an character's [*Knack*](#knacks) might be in line with their [*Equipment*](#equipment) or profession, but it just as easily can be outside.

[*Knacks*](#knacks) are meant to be specific. Avoid generics like "Listening" or "Shooting". Instead, your character might have a [*Knack*](#knacks) in "Throwing large nets", "Climbing over walls", or even "Listening to organ music". Select up to three [*Knacks*](#knacks) for your character.

### Catchphrase

Every hero also has a recognizable way of speaking, which culminates in a catchphrase. Come up with a phrase or term your character might use; once per [*Leg*](#legs) of an adventure you can speak your [*Catchphrase*](#catchphrase) to re-roll a [*Gamble*](#Gambles). The new result replaces the previous roll.

### Next Steps

Once you’ve built out your character, generate your character's Lucky Saves by rolling 1d6. Then, you’re done! [*Peril*](#peril) and [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice) will grow and change as you progress on your adventure!

## The Archetypes

### The Investigator

With a need to uncover the hidden, characters who embody the Investigator archetype are typically the driving force when busting open hidden plots.

Investigators often have occupations like detectives, reporters, or even agents. They are keen-eyed, with a knack for puzzle-solving.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Captain Francis Blake, Master Keaton, Hercule Poirot, Tintin, or Lupin III.

### The Brawler

Always ready for a fight, the Brawler archetype is cruisin’ for a bruisin’. Characters who embody the Brawler archetype often are ready for action at a moment’s notice.

Brawlers can come from a wide variety of backgrounds, from soldiers to thugs. Proficient in many forms of weaponry, Brawlers typically make up for social skills with thick skin.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Bruce Lee, Rocky Balboa, Captain Haddock, Rick O'Connell, or Ryo Saeba.

#### Sample Brawler Drives

| Drive              | Description                                                                 |

### The Researcher

This archetype would much rather have their head in a good book as opposed to a high-octane adventure. Sometimes ignorant of their surroundings, Researchers have a hunger for knowledge and can provide critical for unearthing valuable information.

As the name implies, Researchers typically come from a STEM background. Scientists, teachers, historians, and even musicians can classify as Researchers, given a certain devotion to their work.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Dr. Ellie Satler, Professor Phillip Mortimer, Richard Feynman, Professor Calculus, or Gendo Ikari.

#### Sample Researcher Drives

| Drive             | Description                                                                 |

| Portable scale | Map collection | Geiger counter | Morse code book | Specimen jars | Weather balloon |

### The Entertainer

Not to be confused with the Scott Joplin classic, Entertainers are charismatic assets to any group. They convey many layers of thought in their speech, motion, and even stance.

Entertainer characters might be singers, dancers, or other performers, but they may also come from backgrounds like salesmen.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Charlie Chaplin, Bianca Castafiore, Faye Valentine, Violet Evergarden, or Elvis Presley.

#### Sample Entertainer Drives

| Drive             | Description                                                                 |

| Harmonica | Feather boa | Cane | Business cards | Deck of cards | Confetti|
| Trumpet | Top hat | Jewelry collection | Notebook and pen | Box of tricks | Spotlight|
| Tambourine | Tuxedo | Mirror | Phone book | Champagne | Curtain|
| Accordion | Clown outfit | Perfume bottle | Rolodeck | Tickets | Stilt set|
| Ukulele | Magic wand | Cigarette holder | Announcement flyers | Playing dice | Bouquet|

### The Explorer

The Explorer archetype has wanderlust at their core. Burdened with adventuring gear, they have a keen sense of direction and usually have no difficulty with a map and compass.

Explorer archetype characters are often the easiest to dream up. Dilettantes, nomads, and even industrialists can act as Explorer characters.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Indiana Jones, Lara Croft, Roald Amundsen, Captain Nemo, or Nathan Drake.

#### Sample Explorer Drives

| Drive              | Description                                                                 |

| Chronometer | Rope | Water purification tablets | Field journal | Whip | Pocketwatch |
| Signal mirror | Binoculars | Sunblock | Shovel | Kukri | Astrolabe |

### The Operator

Filling the gaps left by the previous five archetypes, the Operator specializes in something significant. Despite being an expert in what they do, Operator characters bring more than just expertise to the table.

Characters that embody the Operator archetype could be pilots, sea captains, authors, stock brokers, or even gurus. The one thing uniting them is that they know their craft better than anyone else.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Tony Stark, Spike Spiegel, Piotr Skut, Morpheus, or Jock Lindsey

#### Sample Operator Drives

| Drive             | Description                                                                 |

## Gameplay

### Gambles

Whenever an character wants to do something that might fail, they make a [*Gamble*](#gambles). To do this, the player rolls 1d6, adding any relevant [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice).

#### Success

If any die results in a 5 or 6, the action succeeds, and the player narrates what happens.

#### Blunder

If the result is a 1–4, the action fails, and the [*Director*](#the-director) describes what happens.

Pulp heroes don’t fail forever. Whenever a [*Gamble*](#gambles) results in a blunder, the player adds 1 [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice) to their sheet.

#### Peril Increases

Regardless of the outcome, a character's [*Peril*](#peril) increases by 1 for every 1 rolled. This increase is incorporated narratively into the result.

### Modifiers

Often, you won’t roll just one die when making a [*Gamble*](#gambles). Depending on your circumstances, you may add more dice to your pool—or lose some.

#### Bonus Dice

Add 1d6 for each relevant [*Knack*](#knacks), piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment), [*Insight*](#insights), [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice), or external advantage that applies to the action.

#### Penalties

Some [*Equipment*](#equipment) or external factors may impose penalties. For each penalty, remove one die from your pool. A [*Gamble*](#gambles) can never be reduced below 1d6, no matter how many penalties apply.

### Gamble Example

Nara Quinn, the daring archaeologist, is attempting to leap across a collapsing stone bridge.

**Player:** I want Nara to run across the bridge, leaping over the gap to the other side.

**Director:** Okay, this calls for a [*Gamble*](#gambles).

Nara has a [*Knack*](#knacks) for understanding ancient stonework. She also carries her Dad's trusty grappling hook as one of her pieces of [*Equipment*](#equipment). The [*Director*](#the-director) imposes one penalty for Nara's known fear of heights. This results in 2d6 total.

The player rolls: 1 and 5. Nara succeeds but increases her peril by 1.

**Player:** Nara dashes forward, and just before the stone crumbles away, she narrowly leaps across and grabs the ledge with one hand.

### Helping Out

Sometimes a player might want to lend a hand when someone else is making a gamble. In this case, allow a helping player to roll a single [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice) from their [*Knacks*](#knacks) or [*Equipment*](#equipment) and add the result to the acting player's pool.

### Group Gambles

In some cases, all of the players are working to accomplish (or survive) something. In this case, they can make a [*Group Gamble*](#group-gambles). The players collectively decide the [*Success*](#success) and [*Blunder*](#blunder) outcomes, and then each make a [*Gamble*](#gambles) as they normally would, applying any relevant [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice). If the majority of the [*Gambles*](#gambles) result in a [*Success*](#success), the characters succeed. Otherwise, the [*Group Gamble*](#group-gambles) results in a [*Blunder*](#blunder). Any 1's increase that character's [*Peril*](#peril) only.

### Blammo! Dice

Every dog has their day, and every character gets a chance to do something daring. Whenever a character fails a [*Gamble*](#gambles), their player gains a [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice). There is no limit to how many [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice) a character may accrue, and they can be spent on any [*Gamble*](#gambles).

To spend a [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice), the player must declare a unique sound effect, one that hasn't been used yet by any other player. They then describe where that sound effect appears if the [*Gamble*](#gambles) succeeds. They then add 1d6 for each [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice) spent. For example, a player throwing a vase at a goon might say, “PLUNK!” and narrate the moment the vase crashes into the goon's head.

Unlike [*Lucky Save*](#lucky-saves), [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice) must be spent before the roll. If a [*Gamble*](#gambles) is already resolved, it's too late to use them. Once the [*Gamble*](#gambles) is rolled, the dice are cast.

### Lucky Saves

At the start of each new [*Leg*](#legs) of an adventure, each character generates 1d6 Lucky Saves. These represent the sheer dumb luck pulp adventure characters have, which can get them out of a bind. For each [*Lucky Save*](#lucky-saves) a player spends after making a [*Gamble*](#gambles), they may increase the value on a die by one. For example, if a player rolled a 3, they could spend two [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) to increase it to a 5. These must be rationed though, as characters won’t get more points until the next [*Leg*](#legs).

#### Just The Thing

This is an optional rule which can be used at the [*Director's*](#the-director) discretion. Another way players can spend [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) is to spend one to produce a piece of equipment or an item that would be useful for them in that moment. Entered a dark cavern and nobody thought to bring a flashlight? Spend a [*Lucky Save*](#lucky-saves) to make that problem go away.

#### Flashpoints

This is an optional rule which can be used at the [*Director's*](#the-director) discretion. Another way players can spend [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) is to pool them towards a [*Flashpoint*](#flashpoints). During a [*Tumult*](#tumults) the players may elect to initiate a [*Flashpoint*](#flashpoints) by collectively spending [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) equal to the number of players, split by their choosing. This happens before the players begin a new round of turns. In doing so, the [*Director*](#the-director) must now introduce a third variable to the situation. Usually a [*Flashpoint*](#flashpoints) is beneficial to the players, by nature of increasing entropy, but that doesn't always mean it's a friendly ally. Below are some samples of [*Flashpoints*](#flashpoints) that might appear:

- A friendly NPC appears
- A not-so-friendly NPC appears
- A 3rd party or other faction appears
- A natural disaster strikes
- The authorities show up, for better or for worse
- Explosions, lots of explosions

### Peril

No character is invincible. Slowly, the strain of boldly going into the unknown will catch up to them. This is represented as [*Peril*](#peril) and the resulting [*Knockouts*](#knockouts).

Whenever a character experiences a negative consequence, they often accumulate [*Peril*](#peril). A character’s [*Peril*](#peril) ranges from 0–6 at any given time and is often gained from a [*Blunder*](#blunder).

[*Peril*](#peril) can be managed any time the characters take a substantial rest. This may mean a full eight hours of sleep, or just a well-deserved stop for tea in a calming location. When this happens, all players are allowed to make a [*Resting*](#resting) roll.

### Resting

When [*Resting*](#resting), each player rolls 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to their current [*Peril*](#peril), it decreases by one. For example, if a player has 4 [*Peril*](#peril) and rolls a 2, their [*Peril*](#peril) decreases to 3.

### Knockouts

When a character reaches 6 [*Peril*](#peril), they gain a [*Knockout*](#knockouts). This represents a character finally buckling under the tension and going down. It doesn’t always mean being literally knocked out—it might happen during a brawl, but it could also symbolize a character becoming too fatigued or overwhelmed to continue.

Once a character gains a [*Knockout*](#knockouts), their [*Peril*](#peril) resets to 0, and they are incapacitated for the rest of the current [*scene*](#scenes). The Cast will need to decide what to do with them until they recover in the next [*scene*](#scenes). [*Knockouts*](#knockouts) are permanent. If a character gains four [*Knockouts*](#knockouts), they become too weary to go on and must enter [*Retirement*](#retirement).

### Retirement

Not even pulp heroes are invincible, and eventually they meet their end. If a character reaches 4 [*Knockouts*](#knockouts), fear not—they are not removed from the game immediately.

Retired characters continue to play until the end of the current adventure’s [*Leg*](#legs). Until then, their [*Peril*](#peril) no longer increases, but they cannot gain [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice) from modifiers on any roll.

## Running The Show

### Legs

A [*Leg*](#legs) is a segment of a larger adventure. Most adventures have 3–5 [*Legs*](#legs), though the number can vary depending on the type of story the [*Director*](#the-director) creates. Each [*Leg*](#legs) is usually self-contained with its own arc, while still tying into the overarching plot.

### Scenes

Each [*Leg*](#legs) is broken into a series of [*Scenes*](#scenes). In each [*scene*](#scenes), there is a location, a cast of characters, obstacles, and often clues about the villainous scheme. You can think of each [*scene*](#scenes) as a story beat: some bring triumphant moments for the characters, while others plunge them into danger or despair.

An [*scene*](#scenes) typically involves several [*Gambles*](#gambles) to determine the outcomes of the players' actions.

Every [*scene*](#scenes) begins with [*The Wide Shot*](#the-wide-shot), which sets the stage and paints a vivid picture of the situation. After this, the [*Director*](#the-director) asks the players what they’d like to do first.

Whether an [*scene*](#scenes) ends in victory or failure, the story must keep moving. It’s up to the [*Director*](#the-director) to introduce new paths forward—so even if the villain escapes, there's still a compelling story to tell.

### Tumults

Sometimes, all hell breaks loose and the characters find themselves in a high-stakes scenario. This is known as a [*Tumult*](#tumults). In a [*Tumult*](#tumults), time slows down, and players take turns to establish some sense of order.

During a [*Tumult*](#tumults), the players always act first and can choose any turn order—even changing it from round to round. On their turn, a player may do one distinct thing. If the action involves risk or skill, the [*Director*](#the-director) will call for a [*Gamble*](#gambles). Once all players have acted, the [*Director*](#the-director) describes what the enemies and environment do in response.

A [*Tumult*](#tumults) typically ends when one side is knocked out, flees, or surrenders. It’s ultimately up to the [*Director*](#the-director) to decide when a [*Tumult*](#tumults) is over.

### The Director

In order to facilitate the adventures the characters will take on, someone must take on the role of the [*Director*](#the-director).

As the [*Director*](#the-director) you will present the [*Scenes*](#scenes) and adjudicate the [*Gambles*](#gambles) made by the players. Here are some things to keep in mind while running a game:

- Don't feel the need to add lots of sub-plots and things happening in the background. It's certainly a good thing to have a twist or a secret to deploy, but the players will likely be driving the main focus of the adventure

- You are not the villain. You might be playing a villainous character sometimes, but you are still a friend at the table. Root for the characters. Help players spot [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice) they qualify for.

- When in doubt, err on the rule of cool. If you don't know whether or not the players' zany plan will actually work, let them try! This doesn't mean you have to grant their every wish, but it never hurts to allow one more dice roll.

### The Wide Shot

This is a crucial tool for the [*Director*](#the-director) to balance the shared narration. At the start of an [*scene*](#scenes), you will initially describe the space around the characters. Then, allow each player to describe something else in their field of view their character can see. Getting into a taxi? What does each character see that makes them feel uneasy?

Ask leading questions that force them to describe more than just a building or a person. It's very bright here, what might be contributing to the light? The basement is dark and smells strange, what is making the smell worse?

### Snooping

It is common for a character  to look for clues, or even more generally, get a closer look at the world around them. If the situation lends well to it or the character has sufficient skill for snooping, they can simply earn whatever information is available. If the situation is more random or the outcome isn't certain, you can ask the player to roll 1d6.

No [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice), [*Peril*](#peril), or [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) apply here. Closer to 1 means less information and closer to 6 means more information. Notice how on a 1 they don't come up empty handed, the information gained is just more vague or requires a deeper look. This allows for the narrative to keep steaming forward without gatekeeping information behind a [*Gamble*](#gambles); it's just snooping as usual.

### Damage and Peril

In Enigma, there are no hit points or wounds to track; injuries raise a character’s [*Peril*](#peril). If a character twists their ankle, their [*Peril*](#peril) increases, but they still narratively stop and bandage the wound.

As the [*Director*](#the-director), it is your job to dole out [*Peril*](#peril) when necessary. Here is a list of some common places this might happen:

- Any 1's rolled on a [*Gamble*](#gambles)

### Adventuring Strain

While adventuring, characters will accumulate lots of [*Peril*](#peril). [*Peril*](#peril) is always recovered at a time and rate appropriate to the story. If The Cast forges ahead through the night, don’t let them reap the benefits of [*Resting*](#resting).

That being said, if every character gets knocked out because of mismanaged [*Peril*](#peril), don’t let that halt the story progression. One simple solution is to have all the characters awake, just to find themselves captured by the enemy!

### Dangers

As the [*Director*](#the-director), you must present the players with obstacles, enemies, and the other sort. Whether that be henchmen or a boulder rolling down the corridor, these barriers make the game exciting.

NPC’s and other figures you control typically don’t manage [*Peril*](#peril) or dice rolls in the exact same way as players; that would simply put too much strain on the [*Director*](#the-director).

As successes are made against enemies, you can reference the threshold of successes if you are unsure of when the enemy should be bested. In most cases, the narration will dictate when enemies fall, but for major villains it can be useful to count the number of successful "hits".

Each enemy also has a danger rating which is used to dole out [*Peril*](#peril) on their turn. The amount can be split amongst certain characters or directed entirely towards one.

For example, a lieutenant gunning down the characters from a biplane has a danger rating of 3. On their turn they unload hot lead towards the characters; depending on where the characters are standing, it might increase three of the characters' peril by 1, or one of their peril by 3.

| **Enemy Type** |**Success Threshold** | **Danger Rating** |
| Minion | 1 | 1 |
| Lieutenant | 2 | 3 |
| Villain | 4 | 5 |

As the [*Director*](#the-director) you also can take whatever creative liberties you see fit in any given scenario. This can mean manipulating enemy thresholds or danger ratings as needed or removing them entirely.

### Uncovering Treasure

As The Cast moves along with their journey, they should earn rewards in a variety of ways. While not always "Holy Grails", the rewards should equal the risk involved. Here are some forms treasure might take:

- Physical Treasure. It never hurts to have a box of jewels or an expensive painting inside of a secret lair, but as a [*Director*](#the-director) you will need to be careful; often treasure can be used as a MacGuffin to the plot, so an overabundance of it can confuse or dilute the main objective.

- Allies and Connections. Having a pal in this line of business is always useful. As The Cast sufficiently helps out NPC's, you can have them return in other scenarios. These connections can also unlock new modes of travel, money-making schemes, or even inside information

- Shortcuts. All of the above rewards can be boiled down into shortcuts. If the players think critically and roleplay well, they should be rewarded with skipping over obstacles and getting themselves into a better position than before.

## Rules Cheat Sheet

[*Gamble*](#gambles)

- Success if any die reads a 5 or 6. Otherwise, the character’s action fails and their player gains one [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice). [*Peril*](#peril) increases by 1 for every 1 rolled.

[*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice)

- Roll one additional die for each relevant [*Knack*](#knacks), piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment), [*Blammo! Die*](#blammo-dice) spent, or any other external advantage.

[*Penalties*](#penalties)

- Remove one die for each piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment) or external factor that hinders the character. The dice pool cannot be reduced below 1.

[*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves)

- For each [*Lucky Save*](#lucky-saves) a character spends after rolling, the player may increase the value of one die by 1.

[*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice)

- Gained when a [*Gamble*](#gambles) results in failure.
- Can be spent as [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice). For each one spent, the player must include a unique sound effect in the imagined outcome.
- There is no maximum number of [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice) a character can accrue.

[*Peril*](#peril)

- Ranges from 0–6.
- Accumulated from failed [*Gambles*](#gambles), narrative consequences, or at the [*Director’s*](#the-director) discretion.

[*Resting*](#resting)

- Roll 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to the character’s current [*Peril*](#peril), reduce [*Peril*](#peril) by 1.

[*Knockouts*](#knockouts)

- When a character reaches 6 [*Peril*](#peril), they gain a [*Knockout*](#knockouts).
- Their [*Peril*](#peril) resets to 0, and they are incapacitated for the rest of the [*scene*](#scenes) or [*Tumult*](#tumults).
- If a character gains 4 [*Knockouts*](#knockouts), they must enter [*Retirement*](#retirement).

[*Catchphrases*](#catchphrase)

- Can be spent once per [*Leg*](#legs) to re-roll a [*Gamble*](#gambles). This result replaces the previous roll. The new result can also be modified with [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves).
