## Introduction

### Background

ENIGMA is a roleplaying game designed for high-stakes adventure. Inspired by old pulp adventure novels and Franco-Belgian comics with cliche villains, ENIGMA’s system allows players to go on flashy adventures and foil dastardly plots. Just like legendary heroes, players usually triumph and rarely ever die; ENIGMA embraces this, focusing on how the adventurers interact and the results that linger with them for the rest of their careers.

ENIGMA was designed to create the feel of high octane adventures where players can become death defying, luck toting, cartoon pulp heros. It is an engine to tell fantastic stories with your friends.

### Setting

ENIGMA takes its players back to a familiar history in the early 20th century. Ultimately it is up to the Gamemaster (or [*Director*](#the-director)) to decide what has changed. Are there new continents or countries? Perhaps advanced technologies are common. There are always villains acting upon some secret (or not-so-secret) agenda, and it is up to the players to meddle in as many ways as possible.

## The Basics

In order to play ENIGMA, you simply need these rules, some 6 sided dice, pencils, and paper. Designate one person as the [*Director*](#the-director), and have them read the rules on running the game. You will be telling a story as a group, faciliated by the [*Director*](#the-director).

## Making an Adventurer

### The Adventurer Spirit

Your adventurer isn't a villain, a ruthless killer, or a cruel mercenary. You're an adventurer; the type of character who would throw a punch in a bar brawl but wouldn't murder someone in cold blood. You might smash a chair over a goon's head or wallop someone's gun out of their hand, but your spirit is good-hearted. You are bold, brave, imperfect, but fundamentally heroic. When you create your character, ask yourself: Would a child cheer for this person? Would they seem larger-than-life, colorful, and brave, even when they stumble?

In essence: You can be tough. You can be scrappy. But you should always feel like a "good guy".

### Archetypes

In ENIGMA there are 6 different archetypes that are used to represent the different types of adventurers which can appear. An archetype defines the outline of your adventurer, but by no means limits it. They help to guide you when choosing [*Equipment*](#equipment), identifying [*Knacks*](#knacks), and finding your fit in the crew.

The six archetypes are as follows:

- [*The Investigator*](#the-investigator)
- [*The Brawler*](#the-brawler)
- [*The Researcher*](#the-researcher)
- [*The Entertainer*](#the-entertainer)
- [*The Explorer*](#the-explorer)
- [*The Operator*](#the-operator)

Although a balanced group of adventurers keeps things diverse, by no means should the archetypes limit your choices. A group of five entertainers can be just as fun as a mix of roles.

Furthermore, your adventurer doesn’t have to be a human, and often the best companions aren’t! Whether you are a detective robot or a snowy white dog, you'll fit right in.

### Description

Once you have a general adventurer idea, you can describe them with the following fields.

#### Profession

This is what you do on a day-to-day basis. It could be a paid job like "Accountant" or a descriptor like "Drifter"

#### Biography

This is all the government form-type information on your adventurer. How old are you? Where were you born? Where do you live now? What is your full-given birth name? Either respond with stark form answers or write an elegant two-sentence description.

#### Appearance

This is where you can truly describe your adventurer's look. What’s your resting expression? How do you stand? Do you look disheveled or refined? What stands out as unique? You can also use this section to add clothes and other non-trivial items, whatever makes sense for your adventurer.

#### Drives

This is what keeps your adventurer going. You may have an estate back home to take care of, a yearn for another breaking news story, or even just untreated wanderlust. This shouldn't necessarily be a specific goal to complete, like "find my lost father" since the nature of an adventure might never lead you towards that. However, "The hunt for my lost father" could be a drive to keep you adventuring. Each [*Archetype*](#archetypes) has a list of sample [*Drives*](#drives) you can use if you get stuck.

#### Relationships

Select one other person at the table, and form a connection between your adventurer and theirs. You could have been war buddies, old rivals, or even something as simple as childhood friends.

### Equipment

Every adventurer needs tools to help them brave the unknown. This is where [*Equipment*](#equipment) comes into play. Every adventurer can carry the necessary items they need for survival on their person - clothes, food, and the like - but [*Equipment*](#equipment) describes the items that are iconic for them. These are the things that your adventurer is never seen without: a trusty whip, your grandfather's revolver, a professor's folding trowel.

Each piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment) your adventurer has should help tell their story. It can be anything, not just a tool: a moldy sandwich, a dirty washrag, and an ancient stick, etc. These all become valuable items in the eyes of your adventurer, as well as grant [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice) whenever possible.

Select up to two pieces of [*Equipment*](#equipment) that help shape your adventurer. Think of evocative descriptions - the more specific the better. Discuss with your fellow adventurers what you're bringing along, and when it might be useful.

### Knacks

This is your chance to say what your adventurer is great at. Sometimes an adventurer's [*Knack*](#knacks) might be in line with their [*Equipment*](#equipment) or profession, but it just as easily can be outside.

[*Knacks*](#knacks) are meant to be specific. Avoid generics like "Listening" or "Shooting". Instead, your adventurer might have a [*Knack*](#knacks) in "Throwing large nets", "Climbing over walls", or even "Listening to music". Select up to three [*Knacks*](#knacks) for your adventurer, discussing with the table as you did with [*Equipment*](#equipment).

### Next Steps

Once you’ve built out your adventurer, generate  your Lucky Saves by rolling 1d6. Then, you’re done! [*Peril*](#peril), [*Threads*](#threads), and [*Insight*](#insights) will grow and change as you progress on your adventure!

## The Archetypes

### The Investigator

With a need to uncover the hidden, adventurers who choose the Investigator archetype are typically the driving force when busting open hidden plots.

Investigators often have occupations like detectives, reporters, or even agents. They are keen-eyed, with a knack for puzzle-solving.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Captain Francis Blake, Master Keaton, Hercule Poirot, Tintin, or Lupin III.

#### Sample Investigator Drives

| Drive       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Expose the Truth   | You are compelled to uncover secrets and lies, even at personal risk.       |

### The Brawler

Always ready for a fight, the Brawler archetype is cruisin’ for a bruisin’. Characters who choose the Brawler archetype often are ready for action at a moment’s notice, weapon at the ready.

Brawlers can come from a wide variety of backgrounds, from soldiers to thugs. Proficient in all sorts of weaponry, Brawlers typically make up for social skills with thick skin.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Bruce Lee, Rocky Balboa, Captain Haddock, Rick O'Connell, or Ryo Saeba.

#### Sample Brawler Drives

| Drive              | Description                                                                 |

### The Researcher

This archetype would much rather have their head in a good book as opposed to a high-octane adventure. Sometimes ignorant of their surroundings, Researchers have a hunger for knowledge and can provide critical for unearthing valuable information.

As the name implies, Researchers typically come from a STEM background. Scientists, teachers, historians, and even musicians can classify as Researchers, given a certain devotion to their work.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Dr. Ellie Satler, Professor Phillip Mortimer, Richard Feynman, Professor Calculus, or Gendo Ikari.

#### Sample Researcher Drives

| Drive             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Understand the Unknown | You are driven to comprehend what others cannot, no matter how obscure. |
| Preserve Knowledge  | You see it as your duty to safeguard important information or artifacts.   |

| Portable scale | Map collection | Geiger counter | Morse code book | Specimen jars | Weather balloon |

### The Entertainer

Not to be confused with the Scott Joplin classic, Entertainers are charismatic assets to any group. They convey many layers of thought in their speech, motion, and even stance.

Entertainer adventurers might be singers, dancers, or other performers, but they may also come from backgrounds like salesmen.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Charlie Chaplin, Bianca Castafiore, Faye Valentine, Violet Evergarden, or Elvis Presley.

#### Sample Entertainer Drives

| Drive             | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Harmonica | Feather boa | Cane | Business cards | Deck of cards | Confetti|
| Trumpet | Top hat | Jewelry collection | Notebook and pen | Box of tricks | Spotlight|
| Tambourine | Tuxedo | Mirror | Phone book | Champagne | Curtain|
| Accordion | Clown outfit | Perfume bottle | Rolodeck | Tickets | Stilt set|
| Ukulele | Magic wand | Cigarette holder | Announcement flyers | Playing dice | Bouquet|

### The Explorer

With wanderlust at their core, the Explorer archetype is not designed to stay in one place. Burdened with adventuring gear, they are used to traveling with various modes of transportation. Moreover, they have a keen sense of direction and usually have no difficulty with a map and compass.

Explorer archetype adventurers are often the easiest to dream up. Dilettantes, nomads, and even industrialists can act as Explorer adventurers.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Indiana Jones, Lara Croft, Roald Amundsen, Captain Nemo, or Nathan Drake.

#### Sample Explorer Drives

| Drive              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Push the Boundaries | You crave the thrill of discovery and the challenge of venturing where others fear. |
| Map the Unknown     | You feel compelled to chart new territories, leaving no detail undocumented. |
| Seek the Sublime    | You are drawn to the beauty and wonder of the world, seeking awe-inspiring experiences. |
| Escape the Past     | You run from a former life, finding solace in new horizons.                |
| Test Your Limits    | You seek to survive in the harshest conditions and prove your endurance.   |
| Discover Hidden Places | You are fascinated by secret locations and forgotten worlds.            |

#### Sample Explorer Equipment

| Compass | Flint and steel | Pith helmet | Machete | Revolver | Bug repellent |
| Map and map case | Canteen | Hiking boots | Climbing gear | Lever Action Rifle | Specimen jars |
| Sextant | First aid kit | Utility belt | Lantern | Bow and arrows | Local currency |
| Altimeter | Hunting knife | Leather backpack | Portable stove | Throwing knives | Tribal mask |
| Chronometer | Rope | Water purification tablets | Field journal | Whip | Pocketwatch |
| Signal mirror | Binoculars | Sunblock | Shovel | Kukri | Compass |

### The Operator

Filling the gaps left by the previous five archetypes, the Operator specializes in something significant. Despite being an expert in what they do, Operator adventurers bring more than just expertise to the table.

Characters with the Operator archetype could be pilots, sea captains, authors, stock brokers, or even gurus. The one thing uniting them is that they know their craft better than anyone else.

For inspiration, look towards figures like Tony Stark, Spike Spiegel, Piotr Skut, Morpheus, or Jock Lindsey

#### Sample Operator Drives

| Drive             | Description                                                                 |

|  Socket set | Signal flags | Wristwatch | Signal mirror | Throwing knife | Box of rations |

## Gameplay

### Gambles

Whenever an adventurer wants to do something that has a chance of failure, they make a [*Gamble*](#gambles). To do this, the player first states generally what they want to happen on a [*Success*](#success). The [*Director*](#the-director) then sets the stakes; they can either state themselves what will happen on a [*Blunder*](#blunder), or ask the players for ideas. Then the player rolls 1d6.

#### Success

If the player rolls a 5 or a 6, their action succeeds. The player then describes their adventurer's actions with a flourish.

#### Blunder

If the player only rolls 1-4, their action fails. The adventurer automatically gains 1 [*Peril*](#peril), and the [*Director*](#the-director) then describes the failure, building off of the stakes set earlier.

Pulp adventurers never fail forever though, and eventually they'll have their big break. Whenever a gamble results in a blunder, that player also adds 1 [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice) to their sheet.

### Modifiers

Often times, you won't only be rolling a single die on a [*Gamble*](#gambles). Depending on what you have at your disposal you may get to add more dice to your pool.

#### Bonus Dice

For each [*Knack*](#knacks), piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment), [*Insight*](#insights), [*Thread*](#threads), [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice), or external factor that provides some advantage to the action being taken, roll one additional die.

#### Penalties

Sometimes a player might have a penalty applied from [*Equipment*](#equipment) or other external factors. For each penalty applied, the player rolls one less die. Penalties can only ever reduce your dice pool to 1.

### Blammo! Dice

Every dog has their day, and every adventuerer has an opportunity to do something daring. Whenever a player fails a [*Gamble*](#gambles), they gain a [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice). There is no limit to how many [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice) an adventurer may accrue, and they can be used on any [*Gamble*](#gambles).

For each [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice) the player wants to spend, they must state a unique onomatopoeia (that hasn't been used yet by any of the players). The player then describes where the sound effects would appear in the event they succeed. For example, if a player is making a [*Gamble*](#gambles) to throw a large vase at a goon, and wishes to spend a [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice), they might come up with the sound "PLUNK!" and place the sound where the vase hits the goon in the head.

Unlike [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves), these dice cannot be used retroactively; that is, if a [*Gamble*](#gambles) is failed but the adventurer still has [*Blammo! Dice*](#blammo-dice) to spend, they cannot roll more dice. Once the [*Gamble*](#gambles) is made, the die are cast.

### Lending a Hand

Sometimes a player may want to help another player out, especially if they have some skill or expertise. In this case, allow any players who have a [*Knack*](#knacks) or piece of [*Equipment*](#equipment) that would be relevant to grant the helped player a [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice). Each player can only give one [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice) when helping.

### Group Gambles

In other cases, all of the players are working to accomplish (or survive) something. In this case, they can make a [*Group Gamble*](#group-gambles)  the players collectively decide the [*Success*](#success) and [*Blunder*](#blunder) outcomes, and then each make a [*Gamble*](#gambles) as they normally would, applying any relevant [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice). If the majority of the [*Gambles*](#gambles) result in a [*Success*](#success), the adventurers succeed. Otherwise, the [*Group Gamble*](#group-gambles) results in a [*Blunder*](#blunder), and [*Peril*](#peril) increases for all players.

### Lucky Saves

At the start of each new leg of an adventure, your adventurer generates 1d6 Lucky Saves. These represent the sheer dumb luck pulp adventure adventurers have, which can get them out of a bind. For each [*Lucky Save*](#lucky-saves) you spend after making a [*Gamble*](#gambles), you may increase the value on a die by one. For example, if you rolled a 3, you could spend a [*Lucky Save*](#lucky-saves) to increase it to a 4. Keep in mind that you won’t get more points until the next [*Leg*](#legs).

#### Just The Thing!

This is an optional rule which can be used at the [*Director's*](#the-director) discretion. Another way players can spend [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) is to spend one to produce a piece of equipment or an item that would be useful for them in that moment. Entered a dark cavern and nobody thought to bring a flashlight? Spend a [*Lucky Save*](#lucky-saves) to make that problem go away. 

#### Flashpoints

This is an optional rule which can be used at the [*Director's*](#the-director) discretion. Another way players can spend [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) is to pool them towards a [*Flashpoint*](#flashpoints). During a [*Tumult*](#tumults) the players may elect to initiate a [*Flashpoint*](#flashpoints) by collectively spending [*Lucky Saves*](#lucky-saves) equal to the number of players, split by their choosing. This happens before the players begin a new round of turns. In doing so, the [*Director*](#the-director) must now introduce a third variable to the situation. Usually a [*Flashpoint*](#flashpoints) is beneficial to the players, by nature of increasing entropy, but that doesn't always mean it's a friendly ally. Below are some samples of [*Flashpoints*](#flashpoints) that might appear:

- A friendly NPC appears
- A not-so-friendly NPC appears
- A 3rd party or other faction appears
- A natural disaster strikes
- The authorities show up, for better or for worse
- Explosions, lots of explosions

### Threads

As adventurers encounter the weird, strange, and sinister, they can add to their [*Threads*](#threads). At the Director’s discretion, the players can add an idea, group, or person to their sheet after learning more about it.  

Often this occurs at the end of a [*Leg*](#legs). The adventurers bust the secret hideout of a dastardly cult and thus earn a [*Thread*](#threads) about the cult at large. Another example could be unearthing an idol of a lost civilization and thereby gaining a [*Thread*](#threads) for said civilization.

[*Threads*](#threads) can then be leveraged as Modifiers when making a [*Gamble*](#gambles). If a roll involves something a player has a [*Thread*](#threads) about, it grants them a bonus die. If a player has a [*Thread*](#threads) about a cult, they could apply a bonus die to breaking into the cult’s secret door, escaping a monster the cult has summoned, or even punching a member of the cult in the face.

Each adventurer can only have one [*Thread*](#threads) at a time. If you have one and the [*Director*](#the-director) offers another, you can choose to replace your current [*Thread*](#threads).

### Peril

No adventurer is invincible, as slowly the strain of boldly going into the unknown will catch up to them. This is represented as [*Peril*](#peril) and the resulting [*Knockouts*](#knockouts).

Whenever an adventurer has something negative happen to them, an adventurer often accumulates [*Peril*](#peril). Their [*Peril*](#peril) ranges from 0-6 at any given time and is often gained from a Blunder.

[*Peril*](#peril) can be managed anytime the adventurers are taking a substantial rest. This may mean a full eight hours of sleep, or just a well-deserved stop for tea in a calming location. When this happens, all adventurers are allowed to make a [*Resting*](#peril).

### Resting

When [*Resting*](#resting), each player rolls 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to their current [*Peril*](#peril), it decreases by one. For example, if a player has 4 [*Peril*](#peril), and they roll a 2, their [*Peril*](#peril) decreases to 3.

The players should narrate how their adventurer recovers (or doesn’t) when [*Resting*](#resting). Do they meditate? Maybe they shoot cans with their revolver? Perhaps they give a rousing rant about how dire their situation is!

### Knockouts

When an adventurer reaches 6 [*Peril*](#peril), they gain a [*Knockout*](#knockouts). This represents an adventurer finally buckling under the tension and going under. This doesn’t always narratively equate to being knocked out – it may be in a brawl, but it can also just symbolize an adventurer becoming too tired to continue.

Once an adventurer gains a [*Knockout*](#knockouts), their [*Peril*](#peril) reset to 0 and they are incapacitated for the rest of the [*Encounter*](#encounters). The remaining players will have to figure out what to do with them until they wake up during the next [*Encounter*](#encounters). [*Knockouts*](#knockouts) are permanent. Should your adventurer obtain four [*Knockouts*](#knockouts), they become too weary to go on and must cease adventuring and enter [*Retirement*](#retirement).

### Retirement

Not even pulp adventurers are invincible, and eventually they must meet their end. If your adventurer reaches 4 [*Knockouts*](#knockouts), fear not, because they are not out of the game immediately.

Retired adventurers continue play until the end of the adventure’s [*Leg*](#legs). Until then, their [*Peril*](#peril) will not increase, but they cannot receive [*Bonus Dice*](#bonus-dice) modifiers to any roll.

### Insights

The silver lining to gaining [*Knockouts*](#knockouts) is that you also simultaneously gain an [*Insight*](#insights).

An [*Insight*](#insights) is another experiential bonus you can obtain only by screwing up. [*Insight*](#insights) reflect the nature of [*Knockouts*](#knockouts); if you gain that 6th point of [*Peril*](#peril) by nearly drowning in a rushing river, the [*Director*](#the-director) will ask you to describe the [*Insight*](#insights) you gain; you might suggest an [*Insight*](#insights) into "staying afloat even when carrying all this gear".

[*Insight*](#insights) can be used whenever you or another player find themselves in a similar situation, granting them a bonus die. You learned your lesson about drowning, and your fellow adventurers also learn by avoiding your same mistakes.

## Running The Show

### Legs

A [*Leg*](#legs) is a portion of a larger adventure. Typically every adventure has 3-5 [*Legs*](#legs), but there can be more or less depending on the type of adventure your [*Director*](#the-director) creates. [*Legs*](#legs) are often enclosed and have their own arc, but relate to a larger idea or plot.

Each [*Leg*](#legs) essentially works as mini adventure that can be strung together into the larger story. Here's an example:

- Leg 1 - The Strange Auction: A mysterious idol goes missing at a high class auction and the adventurers need to hunt down it's whereabouts.  There are a few different story beats that occur like a chase and a puzzle, which result in the thief being captured. Clearly he is not the mastermind, and fenced off the idol to his boss, leading into leg 2

- Leg 2 - The Journey to Cairo: After discovering that the idol was sent to a rich philanthropist named Baron Chomsky, the adventurers catch a direct flight to Cairo. There is trouble on the plane, and shortly it is hijacked by members of a strange cult. The plane goes down, and the adventurers find themselves struggling to survive in the desert. They find an outpost and resupply after clearing it of the cultists.

- Leg 3 - An Unholy Weapon: The adventurers head into the city and find a tense struggle between the Baron and the Cultists. Both are vying for the idol and the Baron brought it one step closer to the city. The adventurers take a few leads from locals and head towards an abandoned temple. The Baron is attempting to use the idol to activate a powerful weapon, but the Baron and the adventurers are both ambushed by the cult!

As you can see, each [*Leg*](#legs) is a contained segment of the story, like an episode of a TV show. There is a central antagonist to each, but they slowly build up from a cat burglar to the Baron.

### Encounters

Each [*Leg*](#legs) is broken up into a series of events, called [*Encounters*](#encounters). In each [*Encounter*](#encounters), there is a setting, cast, obstacles, and often a major objective. We can think of each [*Encounter*](#encounters) as a story beat; some result in high moments for the adventurers, while others plunge them into the depths of despair.

An [*Encounter*](#encounters) will often involve many [*Gambles*](#gambles) in order to determine the outcome of the players' actions. For example, one [*Encounter*](#encounters) in the example above might be the chase through the city streets. There is a clear goal, setting, cast and a gauntlet of obstacles.

Each [*Encounter*](#encounters) always begins with [*The Wide Shot*](#the-wide-shot) to help paint a better picture of what's going on. Then the [*Director*](#the-director) asks the players what they would like to do first.

Regardless of whether an [*Encounter*](#encounters) ends well for the players, the story must go on. It is up to the [*Director*](#the-director) to provide new threads to follow so that even if the burgler gets away, there is a still a story to tell.

### Tumults

Sometimes all hell breaks loose and the adventurers find themselves in a high stakes scenario. This is known as a [*Tumult*](#tumults). In a [*Tumult*](#tumults), time is slowed down, and players act on a turn so as to establish some sense of order.

During a [*Tumult*](#tumults), the players always go first and can choose whatever order they want - even changing the order between rounds. On each player's turn, they may do one thing; the one thing will be distinct and if it involves skill, the [*Director*](#the-director) will call for a [*Gamble*](#gambles). Once all the players take their turns, the [*Director*](#the-director) then describes what happens with the enemies and environment.

A [*Tumult*](#tumults) will typically end when one side is knocked out, fleeing, or surrendered. It is up to the [*Director*](#the-director) to ultimately decide when a [*Tumult*](#tumults) is over.

### The Director

In order to facilitate the massive adventures the players will take on, someone must take on the role of the [*Director*](#the-director). They help to weave the players’ story together, creating a good time for all.

As the [*Director*](#the-director) you will present the [*Encounters*](#encounters) and adjudicate the [*Gambles*](#gambles) made by the players. Here are some things to keep in mind while running a game:

- Don't feel the need to add lots of sub-plots and things happening in the background. It's certainly a good thing to have a twist or a secret to deploy, but the players will likely be driving the main focus of the adventure

- You are not the villain. You might be playing a villainous character sometimes, but you are still a friend at the table. You should be rooting for the adventurers, helping them find whatever bonuses they can get.

- When in doubt, err on the rule of cool. If you don't know whether or not the players' zany plan will actually work, let them try! This doesn't mean you have to grant their every wish, but it never hurts to allow one more dice roll.

### The Wide Shot

This is a crucial tool for the [*Director*](#the-director) to balance the shared narration. At the start of an [*Encounter*](#encounters), you will describe initially what the adventurers might see. Then, allow each player to describe something else in their field of view their adventurer can see. Getting into a taxi? What does each adventurer see that makes them feel uneasy?

Ask leading questions that force them to describe more than just a building or a person. It's very bright here, what might be contributing to the light? The basement is dark and smells strange, what here is making the smell worse?

In addition to making the [*Encounter*](#encounters) more evocative, you are receiving a goldmine of adventurer-oriented worldbuilding that you can then pick up and sling right back at them later!

### Damage and Peril

In ENIGMA, there is no physical damage or wounds for the players to worry about; in nearly any pulp adventure, pain isn’t what stops the plot from moving forward.

This doesn’t mean that adventurers don’t get injured, but rather, any injuries manifest as an increase of overall [*Peril*](#peril). If an adventurer twists their ankle, their [*Peril*](#peril) increases, but they still narratively stop and bandage the wound or find a stick to walk with.

As the [*Director*](#the-director), it is your job to dole out [*Peril*](#peril) when necessary. Here is a list of some common places this might happen:

- When a player rolls a Blunder on a [*Gamble*](#gambles)
- When an enemy rolls a Success on a [*Gamble*](#gambles)
- When the environment is particularly unforgiving, weather, etc.
- When they encounter the weird, strange, odd, or eldritch
- When you feel like it

### Adventuring Strain

During games adventurers will accumulate lots of [*Peril*](#peril). [*Peril*](#peril) is always recovered at a time and rate appropriate to the story. If the players want to keep forging ahead through the night, don’t let them reap the benefits of [*Resting*](#resting).

That being said, if every adventurer gets knocked out because of mismanaged [*Peril*](#peril), don’t let that halt the story progression. One simple solution is to have all the players awake, just to find themselves captured by the enemy!

### Dangers

As the [*Director*](#the-director), you must present the players with obstacles, enemies, and the other sort. Whether that be henchman or a boulder rolling down the corridor, these barriers make the game exciting.

NPC’s and other figures you control typically don’t manage [*Peril*](#peril) or dice rolls in the exact same way as players; that would simply put too much strain on the [*Director*](#the-director). 

As successes are made against enemies, you can reference the threshold of successes if you are unsure of when the enemy should be bested. In most cases, the narration will dictate when enemies fall, but for major villains if can be useful to count the number of successful "hits".

Each enemy also has a static dice pool they use when rolling against an adventurer to attack or cause harm. The table below has sample pool sizes.

| **Enemy Type** |**Success Threshold** | **Dice Pool** |
| Minion | 1 | 1 |
| Lieutenant | 2 | 3 |
| Villain | 4 | 5 |

As the [*Director*](#the-director) you also can take whatever creative liberties you see fit in any given scenario. This can mean manipulating enemy thresholds or dice pools to smooth over the action, or removing the need for dice rolling entirely.

### Uncovering Treasure

As the party moves along with their journey, they should earn rewards in a variety of ways. While not always Holy Grails, the rewards should equal the risk involved. Here are some forms treasure might take:

- Physical Treasure. It never hurts to have a box of jewels or an expensive painting inside of a secret lair, but as a [*Director*](#the-director) you will need to be careful; often treasure can be used as a MacGuffin to the plot, so an overabundance of it can confuse or dilute the main objective.

- Allies and Connections. Having a pal in this line of business is always useful. Once the party can sufficiently help out an NPC, you can have them return in countless scenarios. These connections can also unlock new modes of travel, money-making schemes, or even inside information

- [*Insights*](#insights). As noted in the Gameplay section, [*Insights*](#insights) are a natural reward for screwing up. When a player earns one, work with them to develop a succinct description of the insight. For example, if the knockout was from fleeing a large lizard, the [*Insights*](#insights) should be specific to capture the fear of a creature but generic enough to apply to more than just lizards.

- Shortcuts. All of the above rewards can be boiled down into shortcuts. If the players think critically and roleplay well, they should be rewarded with skipping over obstacles and getting themselves into a better position than before.
