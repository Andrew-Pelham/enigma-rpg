# F.A.Q

## Why use a d6 system?

The world of pulp adventure is ripe with gambles. Moreover, gambling with standard six sided dice was a common occurrence for the era, so it only made sense to lean into that thematic choice.

Rolling handfuls of six sided dice should invoke that feeling of wheeling and dealing at a table with your friends. And if the game gets dull, it never hurts to bust out a quick game of liar's dice!

## Why use Stress instead of HP?

Pulp adventure is about pursuing the impossible with characters who shouldnâ€™t, and somehow barely escaping with a fiery explosion behind them. Using a health point system bogs down the flow of an adventure, constantly having the adventurers worry about their character dying (or worse). Using Stress allows us to still have a cause-effect relationship, while still keeping their character intact. Characters can still hurt and be wounded, but Stress prioritizes finishing the leg of an adventure.
